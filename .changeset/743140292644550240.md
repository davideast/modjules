🚀 **API Simplification: `SessionClient` Methods**

To create a more intuitive and streamlined developer experience, the primary methods for observing session activities have been promoted from the `ActivityClient` directly onto the `SessionClient`. The `.activities()` namespace has been removed from the public API.

This change reduces the number of concepts a developer needs to learn and makes the API feel more direct and ergonomic. The `ActivityClient` remains as a powerful internal abstraction for managing the local-first cache and network synchronization.

### Before

```typescript
// Old way: Accessing methods through the .activities() getter
const history = await session.activities().history();
const updates = await session.activities().updates();
const selection = await session.activities().select({ type: 'planGenerated' });
```

### After

```typescript
// New, direct way: Methods are available on the session client
const history = await session.history();
const updates = await session.updates();
const selection = await session.select({ type: 'planGenerated' });
```

This is a breaking change for users who were using the `session.activities()` methods directly. The migration path is to simply remove the `.activities()` call.
